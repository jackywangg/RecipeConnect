# Recipe Connect Project

## Proposal
Recipe Connect is an application that primarily stores recipes, which includes its ingredients and instructions. However, a feature within this application focuses on ingredients - being able to check which ingredients can be used in more than one recipe (hence, *connect* one recipe with another ingredient-wise). This can help narrow down "essential" ingredients to encourage cost-effective grocery shopping.

The focus group for this project are **students** or **homecooks** - those who primarily cook at home as opposed to eating outside or purchasing takeout. As a student who enjoys cooking and aims to minimize spending, I am interested in developing a project that can store and track recipes, making it easier to plan meals and reduce waste. For example, it would help to make wary of purchasing ingredients that are only used in a few dishes; in my case, black bean paste, which I bought months ago and rarely use except for black bean noodles. Furthermore, this is useful for those living away from family as it reduces the number of items to bring or waste when moving.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add an ingredient into a recipe.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of ingredients in a recipe.
- As a user, I want to ensure that I am notified or wary of ingredients that can be used in more than one recipe (i.e., a mark or star beside the ingredient).
- As a user, I want to select a set of ingredients and randomize a recipe that includes the ingredients I selected.
