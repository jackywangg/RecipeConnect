# Recipe Connect Project

## Proposal
Recipe Connect is an application that primarily stores recipes, which includes its ingredients and instructions. However, a feature within this application is to call a random recipe within your collection of recipes to reduce time spent on choosing what to cook.

The focus group for this project are **students** or **homecooks** - those who primarily cook at home as opposed to eating outside or purchasing takeout. As a student who enjoys cooking but tries to minimize cooking time, I am interested in developing a project that can store and track recipes, making it easier to plan or choose meals.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add an ingredient into a recipe.          
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of ingredients in a recipe. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view the number of ingredients in each recipe and the number of recipes in my collection.                                                   
- As a user, I want to be able to view the instructions pertaining to a recipe.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a recipe form my list of recipes   
- As a user, I want to grab a random recipe among the recipes I've created.
